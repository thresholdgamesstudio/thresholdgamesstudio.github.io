  <div class="font-['Courier_Prime'] text-[#f4f4f4] leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-wrap text-sm md:text-base"><p>SUBJECT: Rigor Mortis Implementation
PRIORITY: High</p>
<p>Standard ragdoll physics feel too loose for our requirements. Bodies in 'Threshold' cannot flop like empty sacks; they must carry the weight of the dead.</p>
<p>We are implementing a localized stiffness system. When an enemy is neutralized:</p>
<ol>
<li>Joints lock progressively based on the time of death.</li>
<li>Impact force is preserved, allowing for 'knockback' that feels heavy and brutal.</li>
<li>We encountered a bug where the physics engine calculated infinite mass for the bowler hats. This has been rectified, though the 'Lethal Hat' mechanic is being considered for a spin-off.</li>
</ol>
