  <div class="font-['Courier_Prime'] text-[#f4f4f4] leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-wrap text-sm md:text-base"><p>SUBJECT: Environmental Audio Synthesis
LOCATION: Whitechapel District (Simulation)</p>
<p>We have successfully captured the acoustic signature of heavy rainfall on cobblestone. The initial synthesis lacked 'weight', sounding more like static than precipitation.</p>
<p>ADJUSTMENTS MADE:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added randomized pitch modulation to droplet impacts based on surface material (Cobble vs. Wood vs. Flesh).</li>
<li>Implemented spatial occlusion for overhangs and archways.</li>
<li>Recorded foley samples using wet wool and slate tiles.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result is haunting. When the player stands under the gaslight, the rain doesn't just look real—it feels cold. The dampness seems to seep through the speakers.</p>
