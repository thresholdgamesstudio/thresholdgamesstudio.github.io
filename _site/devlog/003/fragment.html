<p>Q: You spent three weeks studying Victorian boxing manuals?
A: Bare-knuckle boxing is distinct. It's not about the gloves; it's about bone alignment. If you punch wrong, you break your hand, not their jaw.</p>
<p>Q: How does this translate to gameplay?
A: The animations are deliberate. We removed the &quot;snap&quot; common in modern fighters. Every swing has a wind-up, a commitment. If the player misses, they are left wide open. It's a game of risk.</p>
<p>Q: And the tea drinking animation?
A: Mocap for that was... extensive. We went through four kettles.</p>
