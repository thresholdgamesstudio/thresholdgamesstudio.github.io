SUBJECT: Environmental Audio Synthesis
LOCATION: Whitechapel District (Simulation)

We have successfully captured the acoustic signature of heavy rainfall on cobblestone. The initial synthesis lacked 'weight', sounding more like static than precipitation.

ADJUSTMENTS MADE:

- Added randomized pitch modulation to droplet impacts based on surface material (Cobble vs. Wood vs. Flesh).
- Implemented spatial occlusion for overhangs and archways.
- Recorded foley samples using wet wool and slate tiles.

The result is haunting. When the player stands under the gaslight, the rain doesn't just look real—it feels cold. The dampness seems to seep through the speakers.
