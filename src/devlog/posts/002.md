SUBJECT: Rigor Mortis Implementation
PRIORITY: High

Standard ragdoll physics feel too loose for our requirements. Bodies in 'Threshold' cannot flop like empty sacks; they must carry the weight of the dead.

We are implementing a localized stiffness system. When an enemy is neutralized:

1. Joints lock progressively based on the time of death.
2. Impact force is preserved, allowing for 'knockback' that feels heavy and brutal.
3. We encountered a bug where the physics engine calculated infinite mass for the bowler hats. This has been rectified, though the 'Lethal Hat' mechanic is being considered for a spin-off.
